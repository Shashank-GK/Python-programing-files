 “Life is a matter of choices, and every choice you make makes you”- John C Maxwell. 
This project presents the development of an Arduino-based sign language glove that can 
translate hand gestures into spoken language. The glove uses flex sensors to detect finger 
movements, which are processed by the Arduino microcontroller to produce speech output 
through a speaker or headphones. The aim of the project is to provide a low-cost and 
portable solution for real-time communication between people with hearing or speech 
impairments and those who do not know sign language.
